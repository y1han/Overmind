<EDIT 6.11.18: Version migration code is now automated; disregard this message.>

Since Overmind is not in a stable development cycle yet (v0.x), there will sometimes be non-backward
compatible changes. This directory contains code to help you migrate an existing installation of Overmind
to a more recent version. When a new version of Overmind is released, migration code will usually be
included and will run automatically; however, this migration code will eventually be removed once most
people have updated to the most recent version and will be archived to this directory.

To update a very old version of Overmind, add the corresponding migration function to the end of your main
loop and run it until the console alerts you that the version has been safely migrated. Do this one
migration step at a time (e.g. to update from 0.2.X to 0.4.X, use 0.2.x->0.3.0 until it is finished, then
use 0.3.x->0.4.0 until finished). If you run into technical difficulties, feel free to ping me on the
#overmind Slack channel @Muon.
